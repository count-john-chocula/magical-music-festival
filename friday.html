         <h2>THE LINE-UP: A CHRONICLE OF SONIC SORCERY</h2>
    <p>Mike has outdone himself, mortgaging several minor souls and a prime spectral real estate plot to secure this cacophony of legends. The stage, known as "The Rift," is crafted from petrified ego and unstable dream-stuff. Lineup subject to change based on astral alignment, contractual hexes, and who wins the backstage Mumblety-peg tournament.</p>

        <h3>FIRESDAY: GRAVEYARD SMASH – A NIGHT OF RIFFS, RIBS, AND RESURRECTED RIFFS</h3>

            <h4><span class="act-time">3:33 PM</span> - The Opening Incantation</h4>
            <p>A collective hum led by the Sisters of Perpetual Resonance to stabilize the local reality just enough so the first band doesn't vaporize us all.</p>


       
            <h4><span class="act-time">5:55 PM</span> - The Cauldron Bubbles Over</h4>
            <p>Up-and-coming swamp-rock shamans <strong>Bogwart and the Oozes</strong> perform their cult hits <em>"My Hex Before You"</em> and <em>"That's the Way (The Ouroboros Crunches)."</em></p>
     

        
            <h4><span class="act-time">8:08 PM</span> - Pre-Mosh Calibration</h4>
            <p>Psychadelic drone collective <strong>The Mycelium Network</strong> will perform their 45-minute tone poem, <em>"A Mycorrhizal Symphony for Subterranean Consciousness."</em> This is either a transcendent experience or a great time to secure your spot at the sausage cart. There is no in-between.</p>
        

        
            <h4><span class="act-time">HEADLINER, MIDNIGHT</span> - THE ROLLING BONES</h4>
            <p>The grandmasters of calcified rock return, their bones polished to a high sheen, their hollow eyes glowing with arcane amplifier fire. Their set is a masterclass in undead energy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sympathy for the Wizard:</strong> Features a 12-minute marimba solo played on spinal columns.</li>
                <li><strong>Wizard's Tongue:</strong> Now with a live cursing choir for enhanced lyrical vitriol.</li>
                <li><strong>Paint It, Black (with Arcane Ink):</strong> The legendary finale. The ensuing mosh pit, known as "The Ossuary," is a vortex of joyful aggression.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note"><strong>Mosh Pit Etiquette:</strong> No intentional polymorphing. No summoning intermediary demons as wingmen. If you find a detached radius or ulna, please deposit it gently in the "Lost and Found (Mostly Lost)" bin.</p>
