         <h2>FINAL WORD FROM MIKE HIMSELF (SCRATCHED ON THE BACK OF A DRAGON'S LEASE AGREEMENT):</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Look. It's gonna be loud, weird, and your feet will hurt. You'll question your life choices at least twice. But for three days, you're not a wizard, a witch, or a warlock... you're a fan. And that's the most powerful magic of all. Also, <strong>BUY THE MERCH.</strong> I owe a LOT of people a LOT of Grotos."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="tagline"><strong>Magic Mike's Massive Medieval Music Mania Festival:</strong> It's a logistical nightmare wrapped in an acoustic phenomenon, deep-fried in pure, unadulterated hubris. Come. Be discombobulated.</p>
