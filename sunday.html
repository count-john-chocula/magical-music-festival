          <h3>SUNDOOM: PSYCHEDELIC PROGand EXISTENTIAL DRIP – A JOURNEY INWARD (AND OUTWARD, AND SIDEWAYS THROUGH A KALEIDOSCOPE)</h3>

    
        <h4><span class="act-time">1:11 PM</span> - Soothing the Collective Hangover</h4>
        <p><strong>The Aural Unction</strong> provides ambient sound baths using tuned crystal skulls and humming obsidian orbs. Many will weep. Some will simply snore.</p>
   

    
        <h4><span class="act-time">3:33 PM</span> - Progressive Prelude</h4>
        <p><strong>*Jethro Troll</strong>'s epic saga <em>"Aqualung (of the Bog)"</em> performed in its entirety by a 40-piece ensemble featuring hurdy-gurdy and aggrieved water sprites. <span class="note">(*Not affiliated with Jethro Tull, just a very litigious troll.)</span></p>
    

    
        <h4><span class="act-time">6:66 PM (A Special Timeless Moment)</span></h4>
        <p>The legendary <strong>The Arcane Floyd</strong> begins their soundcheck. This is, for many, the main event.</p>
   

    
        <h4><span class="act-time">HEADLINER, TWILIGHT TO ETERNITY</span> - THE ARCANE FLOYD</h4>
        <p>This is not a concert. It is a shared psychic expedition into the cosmos of the mind, funded by outrageous ticket prices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Wizard's Side of the Moon:</strong> Performed as a continuous sonic tapestry. The iconic heartbeat is actually the amplified pulse of the Great Old One temporarily powering the generators.</li>
            <li><strong>Eclipse of the Sorcerer:</strong> During <em>David Gimour</em>'s legendary solo, the actual moon will appear to weep prismatic tears. This is just a very expensive hologram. Probably.</li>
            <li><strong>Another Scribe in the Wall, Parts 1, 2, & 3:</strong> The monumental climax. A giant, inflatable pedagogue will loom over the crowd. The ensuing pyrotechnic display is officially classified as "educational reform."</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><strong>Bring a handkerchief.</strong> You will feel things. You will also likely be covered in metaphorical (and possibly literal) ash.</p>
