         <h3>SPELLURDAY: NECROMANCY'S BOOGIE NIGHT – SPARKLES, SHRIEKS, AND SYNCOPATED SHAMBOLISM</h3>

    
        <h4><span class="act-time">2:22 PM</span> - Bardic Battles</h4>
        <p>The semi-finals of the "Lute-Limbo" competition. How low can your melody go?</p>
   

    
        <h4><span class="act-time">4:44 PM</span> - Illusionary Support</h4>
        <p><strong>Mirage (Featuring Special Guest, Mirage)</strong> will perform their greatest hits, which you will forget immediately upon hearing them. A truly unique experience.</p>
   

    
        <h4><span class="act-time">7:11 PM</span> - Undead Warm-Up</h4>
        <p><strong>Zombie-Zombie</strong> (a meta-commentary cover band of the fictional band "Zombie") plays perfect renditions of songs that don't exist. They are fantastically derivative.</p>
   

   
        <h4><span class="act-time">HEADLINER, MOONRISE</span> - MYCROFT JACKSON & THE GRAVE GLIDERS</h4>
        <p>The air will crackle with static and the faint scent of embalming fluid. Mycroft's arrival is heralded by a single, sparkling glove descending from a rift in the sky.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Billie Jean the Mage:</strong> Features a jury of twelve illusory familiars deciding a paternity case mid-song.</li>
            <li><strong>Thriller: The Reanimation Spell:</strong> The local necromancers' union has picketed this performance for years, calling it "flashy, non-unionized reanimation." It's spectacular.</li>
            <li><strong>The Man in the Mirror Dimension:</strong> Attendees report leaving this song with a better haircut and a worse personality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><strong>Special Note:</strong> The "Thriller" dance lesson is led by a supremely impatient lich. He will not tolerate half-hearted zombie poses.</p>
