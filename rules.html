         <h2>SURVIVAL MANIFESTO: RULES, REGULATIONS, AND REALITIES</h2>

    
        <h3>Tickets and Entry:</h3>
        <p>Your ticket is a small, angry imp named <strong>Kevin</strong> sealed in a crystal. He will shriek your entry confirmation. <strong>DO NOT SET HIM FREE.</strong> Lost your imp? The Bureaucracy of Bards at the front gate will solve your problem in 4-6 business eras.</p>
  

    
        <h3>Currency:</h3>
        <p>The official festival coin is the <strong>"Groto."</strong> Exchange rates are: <em>10 Gold Pieces = 1 Groto. 1 Groto = 1 Sausage.</em> A pint of Goblin Brew is 3 Grotos, or your most interesting secret. ATMs dispense gold dust at a ruinous exchange fee.</p>
    

   
        <h3>Wardrobe:</h3>
        <p>Enchanted clothing is encouraged but may interact poorly with the stray resonance of The Rift. <strong>We are not liable</strong> for cloaks that develop stage fright, boots that walk you to the parking lot against your will, or hats that develop a crushing sense of inferiority.</p>
    

    
        <h3>Conjuring and Casting:</h3>
        <p><strong>ABSOLUTELY NO UNAUTHORIZED SUMMONING, PORTALING, OR WEATHER ALTERATION.</strong> The magical resonance field is at 112%. A single misplaced <em>"Accio Cold Beer"</em> could collapse the entire site into a minor demon's snack cupboard. Use the provided summoning circles in designated areas (located next to the porta-cauldrons).</p>
    

    
        <h3>Departure:</h3>
        <p>At festival's end, a massive <strong>"Dispel"</strong> will be cast. You will find yourself gently but firmly deposited back at the Mystic Springs truck stop, slightly changed, mildly deafened, smelling of smoke and wonder, and in possession of a counterfeit <em>"I Survived Magic Mike's"</em> talisman that will crumble to dust by Tuesday.</p>
