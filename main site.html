    <h1>Announcement: Magic Mike's Massive Medieval Music Mania Festival</h1>
  <p>Do your robes feel stale? Is your familiar judging your lack of social life? Does your crystal ball only get sports channels? For three days only, cast aside the humdrum of incantations and elixirs for the ONLY sonic gathering that matters for the discerning spell-slinger.</p>
  <p>We’ve conjured a lineup so potent, it required approval from three separate temporal oversight councils. Prepare your ear-drums and your mana pools, Because It’s time to emerge from your hermitage and shake the owl droppings from your best ceremonial robes and immerse yourself in the MOST ostentatiously advertised, marginally organized, and acoustically questionable gathering in the mystical calendar</p>
  <p>For three days, we replace the gentle bubbling of cauldrons with earth-shaking bass drops and the whispering of ancient tomes intertwined with the screams of several thousand very enthusiastic, very intoxicated magic users.</p>
  <p>Mike, the "Magic"(a title he gave himself after successfully ordering a double-shot illusion at Starbucks), has once again leveraged his dubious charm and several poorly-worded binding contracts to assemble a lineup that will, in his own words, "unmake reality and then remix it with a sick beat." We cannot confirm the reality-remixing, but we have confirmed a significant spike in local hedgehog anxiety.</p>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> The Eldritch Moora temporary pocket dimension tethered precariously to the forgotten service road behind the "Mystic Springs" truck stop off Exit 66. (Just past the third mirage on the I-95, blink and you'll miss the reality-warp.) GPS will fail, Follow the scent of brimstone and fried dough. You'll know you're close when your familiar develops a sudden migraine.</p>
  <p><strong>Dates:</strong> The Triad of Turmoil: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday<br>
  2 weeks from next half harvest and a bit.</p>
  <p>Hope to see you sick and twisted individuals there.</p>

           <h3>SUNDAY NIGHT: COSMIC PROG-SORCERY - A JOURNEY TO THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON (LITERALLY, A ROCK IS COMING LOOSE)</h3>
    <h4>Headliner: The Arcane Floyd</h4>
    <p>The architects of auditory awe, the sultans of synaptic soundscapes. This isn't a performance; it's a three-hour collective astral projection. Lie on the "Psychic Repose" grass field (a.k.a. the muddy ditch they won't let us charge extra for), and let the synesthesia take hold.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Full album performance of <em>The Wizard's Side of the Moon</em>:</strong> From the heartbeats and manic laughter in "Speak to Me (Oh Great Spirit)" to the soul-crushing loneliness of "Brain Damage (From Unsanctioned Scrying)."</li>
        <li><strong>Eclipse of the Sorcerer:</strong> A 23-minute guitar solo played on a lute strung with captured sunbeams and wailing phantoms. May cause temporary blindness and profound philosophical regret.</li>
        <li><strong>The grand finale: <em>Another Scribe in the Wall, Parts 1, 2, and 3</em>:</strong> A blistering indictment of magical academia, standardized familiar testing, and the soul-grinding monotony of transcribing spellbooks. Features a chorus of one thousand illusory children chanting "We don't need no incantation / We don't need no thought control" before a giant, metaphorical wall of fire consumes the stage. <span class="note">Metaphorical. Probably.</span></li>

       <h2>The Enchanting and Potentially Catastrophic Line-Up:</h2>
  
    <h3>FRIDAY NIGHT: THE BONE-RATTLING REVELRY - MOSH MAGIC and MINOR TEARS IN THE VEIL</h3>
    <h4>Headliner: The Rolling Bones</h4>
    <p>These skeletal stalwarts of stadium rock-n-roll necromancy are back from the dead (again) and angrier than a basilisk with a stone complex. Their setlist is a grimoire of gritty anthems that will have you headbanging so hard your pointy hat will become a lethal projectile.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sympathy for the Wizard:</strong> A haunting ballad about the existential crisis of having ultimate power but still having to unclog your own temporal sinkhole.</li>
      <li><strong>Wizard's Tongue:</strong> Not for the easily offended or literally cursed. A rollicking tune about gossip that spreads faster than a plague sprite.</li>
      <li><strong>Paint It, Black (with Arcane Ink):</strong> Their iconic finale, where the entire Moor is plunged into an abyssal darkness, illuminated only by violently swirling, sentient tattoos that leak from the stage. The Mosh Pit for this number is less a dance and more a ritualized combat sport.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note"><em>Note: The festival provides complimentary "Mending" tents for dislocated shoulders and spontaneously fractured souls. Liability for exiled limbs is capped at 10 silver pieces.</em></p>
  
    <h3>SATURDAY NIGHT: THE NECROMANTIC GROOVE SESSION - THRILLS, CHILLS, AND REANIMATED SKILLS</h3>
    <h4>Headliner: Mycroft Jackson and His Undead Background Dancers (The "Grave Gliders")</h4>
    <p>The King of Pop-Culture Necromancy, the Sultain of Spellbound Swing, the Man in the Mithril Glove! Mycroft’s show isn't a concert; it's a meticulously choreographed uprising from the grave. His dancers, freshly exhumed for your enjoyment, perform with a rigor mortis-defying flexibility.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Billy Jean the Mage:</strong> A tale of magical paternity suits and illusory doppelgangers. Features a moonwalk that literally creates a short-lived lunar eclipse.</li>
      <li><strong>Thriller: The Reanimation Spell:</strong> The full 14-minute saga. Local cemeteries have been placed on high alert. The crowd-wide zombie dance tutorial is mandatory; refusal results in being voluntold for the pyrotechnics crew.</li>
      <li><strong>The Man in the Mirror Dimension:</strong> A psychedelic ballad that traps the audience in a recursive, funhouse reality for what feels like seven years (actual elapsed time: 8 minutes). You will confront yourself. You will find your copy underwhelming.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="special-effect"><strong>Special Effect:</strong> A confetti cannon that fires enchanted cobwebs and shrieking skulls made of ectoplasm. It’s disgusting. You’ll love it.</p>
